   I'm a graduate of Longwood High School, and have lived on Long Island my entire life. I've changed what I've wanted as a career many timess in life, but technology has always had a pull on me. My hobbies include reading, listening to music, and playing games. I'm rather asocial, but I'm working on that. I'm now a student of RIT, specifically majoring within GCCIS.
   
   (I would include some pictures of my favorite foods, but I don't have any on hand. These include Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Ice Cream, Steak, Chicken, Tomatoes, Apples, Bananas, and Sandwhiches.)
